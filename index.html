						<p>“We initially designed æternity hyperchain for BitcoinNG and quickly realized its expansive potential. Now, anyone can use hyperchain to create child-chains that alleviate pressure from the mainnet without sacrificing security. In this way, we can leverage the mainnet for PoW while also using PoS to improve privacy and scalability for the entire network."</p>

							<h2>PoW VS PoS</h2>
							<p> <strong>A consensus algorithm is a mechanism that allows users or machines to communicate and coordinate in a distributed setting.</strong></p>
							<p>Consensus algorithms ensure that all agents in a system can agree on a single source of truth — even if some agents fail.</p>
							<p>There are many different types of blockchain consensus algorithms. The two most widely-used consensus algorithms — Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS ) — each possess advantages and disadvantages regarding security and scalability of the network.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-plus"></span>
									<h3>PoW Pros</h3>
									<p>Proof of Work creates <strong>secure</strong> blockchain networks that are highly <strong>resistant to attacks</strong>, rewarding miners with both block rewards and transaction fees. The Proof of Work model is the <strong>simplest, most widely used</strong> consensus protocol and is suitable for a wide variety of applications.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-minus"></span>
									<h3>PoW Cons</h3>
									<p>Proof of work is extremely <strong>energy-intensive</strong> — PoW networks are costly, consuming increasingly vast amounts of computing power. The progressive centralization of hashing power through mining pools introduces the <strong>risk of single-party network dominance</strong>.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-plus"></span>
									<h3>PoS Pros</h3>
									<p>Proof of Stake consensus models <strong>eliminate energy wastage</strong>, operating with <strong>higher efficiency</strong>. Network participants are motivated by financial stake, with transactions processed by participants with the most to lose. Fast consensus between validators allows for <strong>rapid operations at scale</strong>.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-minus"></span>
									<h3>PoS Cons</h3>
									<p>Proof of Stake networks are </strong>less secure</strong> than Proof of Work networks and are potentially more susceptible to low-cost attacks. Unrestricted stake accumulation can lead to <strong>centralization.</strong></p>

							<h2>Why Hyperchains</h2>
							<p><strong>Hyperchains are hybrid blockchains that combine the best of both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake consensus.</strong></p>
                            <p>Hyperchains are linked to a parent blockchain that operates via the Proof of Work protocol, providing robust security. Each Hyperchain operates on the Proof of Stake protocol, delivering speed and efficiency.</p>
                            <p>A parent PoS blockchain secures and checkpoints the child Hyperchain. The election of validators on the child Hyperchain are dependent on the parent chain. Hyperchains deliver four key advantages over single consensus protocol blockchain networks:</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-rocket"></span>
									<h3>Infinite Scalability</h3>
									<p>The potential use cases of blockchain technology are limited by the rate at which commitments can be made to PoW networks. Hyperchains deliver infinite scalability and can be stacked endlessly, solving the scalability problem.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-coins"></span>
									<h3>Low Cost Accessibility</h3>
									<p>Hyperchains are efficient, with a negligible operational cost when compared to Proof of Work networks. Use-case-specific heavy lifting is performed within PoS Hyperchains, secured by parent PoW chains.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Privacy & Security</h3>
									<p>Hyperchains leverage parent chain Proof of Work consensus and don’t need to be secured by permission-intensive practices such as merge-mining. Nobody needs to ask for permission to create highly secure, private Hyperchains governed by hybrid PoS/PoW consensus.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Power to the people</h3>
									<p>With Hyperchains, anyone can create their own secure, private blockchain — for any use case, in any application, with minimal technical expertise. </p>

							<h2>Use Cases</h2>
							<p><strong>Hyperchains allow creators to develop bespoke use-case specific networks for specific needs or applications. The highly customizable nature of Hyperchains allows users to limit or extend the protocol according to their requirements.</strong></p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-users"></span>
									<h3>Community Sharing</h3>
									<p>Hyperchains create opportunities for decentralized sharing — communities can create private or public Hyperchains to share data quickly and efficiently.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-city"></span>
									<h3>Corporate Applications</h3>
									<p>Companies and enterprise organizations use Hyperchains to instantly create and deploy internal blockchain-based applications such as governance, identity management, or document identification tools.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-coins"></span>
									<h3>Private Business</h3>
									<p>Hyperchains provide private businesses with the ability to generate, distribute, and track branded blockchain-based tokens that can be used for customer loyalty, rewards, or membership programs.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-globe"></span>
									<h3>Digital Assets & Economies</h3>
									<p>The high speed and scalability of Hyperchains are ideal for any virtual ecosystem — create Hyperchain tokens for use as in-game currency, or develop entire marketplaces that operate on dedicated internal Hyperchains.</p>
